*Human-sized cat spirit. Twice the tails, twice the trouble.*

6 HP, 2 Armor, 12 STR, 16 DEX, 12 WIL, Claws (d6 + d6 damage)

`Shapechanging`

- Can change into a person, a house cat, or a human-sized, two-tailed, bipedal cat.
- Able to sense the presence of any creature within 30 feet of it that is invisible or ethereal. It can pinpoint such a creature that is moving.
- **Fire starter**: With a glare, a nekomata can set a flammable object on fire.
- **Beguile**: One target must make a `WIL save` or become `beguiled`. They are still capable of independent thought and decision making, but they favor the nekomata and its friends, considering them important allies.
- **Raise dead**: the nekomata can cause a fresh corpse to rise as a zombie under its control.

The nekomata, or forked cat, is a two-tailed variety of bakeneko. While they are born in the same way as other bakeneko, only the oldest and meanest become nekomata. When one of these domestic cats becomes a y≈çkai, its tail splits down the center, creating two identical tails. Then, like bakeneko, they begin walking on two legs, grow to the size of adult humans, and begin speaking.

Unlike bakeneko, who enjoy causing mischief but are not inherently malicious, nekomata view humans and their ilk with contempt. They use their control of fire to kill those they dislike, animate corpses to use as servants, and use their enchantment magic to blackmail or enslave hapless humans.
