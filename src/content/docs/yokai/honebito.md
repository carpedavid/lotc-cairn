*Rotting, fetid, maggot-ridden, and absolutely irresistible.*

3 HP, 0 Armor, 10 STR, 8 DEX, 14 WIL, Draining kiss (1d4 stress)

`Undead`

- **Beguile**: One target must make a `WIL save` or become `beguiled`. They perceive the honebito as the most beautiful person they've ever seen and will do anything within their power to please them.

While some undead are trapped in the physical world by anger or hatred, honebito are motivated by an all-consuming lust. They project a powerful illusion of beauty and vitality which enable them to seduce the living. They then slowly drain their victims' life force, leaving behind nothing more than a shriveled husk.
