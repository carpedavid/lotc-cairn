As cats age, they develop supernatural powers and turn into yōkai. Some turn into bakeneko, more powerful and malevolent cats turn into nekomata, and the oldest of those who have learned to hate humans turn into kasha. While their name means “fire cart,” kasha have nothing to do with flaming transportation. Instead they are large bipedal felines who are surrounded by hellish flames and crackling electricity.

Kasha feed on fresh human corpses, and are most frequently encountered at funeral services, where they have been waiting, disguised as a typical house cat. When the body is unattended for a moment, the kasha transforms and snatches the corpse.

In order to prevent kasha from absconding with the bodies of the recently deceased, shinkan perform elaborate rituals, hold decoy funeral ceremonies, and prepare their shrines with ōfuda to ward against them.
