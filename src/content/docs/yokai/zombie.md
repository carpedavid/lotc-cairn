*Dead eyes. Stiff gait. Uncanny lack of respiration.*

6 HP, 0 Armor, 10 STR, 6 DEX, 3 WIL, Bite (d6 damage)

`Undead`

The most striking thing about zombies is how human they look. Even as they deteriorate, dripping blood and trailing torn flesh, even as they grab you with their cold, stiff arms, they still look like someone you might have known â€“ maybe even loved.

Unless directed otherwise, zombies mindlessly attack any living creature that comes near them.
