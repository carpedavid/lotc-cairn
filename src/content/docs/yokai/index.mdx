- `Elemental (fire)` creatures are so closely aligned with the element of fire that `Elemental (water)` attacks against them are `enhanced` and `Elemental (metal)` attacks against them are `impaired`.
- `Incorporeal` creatures lack physical form and are comprised solely of dark energy. They are immune to `damage`.
- `Kitsune`
- `Mindless` creatures lack the capacity to learn, plan, and make decisions. When under someone's control, they can follow basic instructions but interpret them literally. They are immune to `stress`.
- `Oni`
- `Shapechanging` creatures can, at will, change their size, shape, and appearance. In each form, the creature's statistics remain the same, though they may be unable to utilize weapons or armor not suited to their new form. Any equipment the creature is wearing or carrying isnâ€™t transformed. The shapechanger reverts to its true form if it dies.
- `Undead` creatures are the bodies and spirits of previously living creatures which are animated by the dark energy of Yomi, the World of Darkness. They do not need to breathe, eat, or sleep to continue existing, though many of them have an overwhelming desire for human flesh.
