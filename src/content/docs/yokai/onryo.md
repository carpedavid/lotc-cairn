*Black eyes punctuate an expression of utter contempt.*

8 HP, 1 Stability, 10 STR, 10 DEX, 15 WIL, Cold touch (d8 stress)

`Incorporeal`, `Undead`

- **Hex**: One target must make a `WIL save` or become `hexed`. Everything is now harder for that creature than it was before. For example, all attacks made by the target are `impaired`. This curse lasts until it is removed by purification.

Onryō are spirits of the deceased who have been trapped in the physical world by their intense emotions — typically jealousy, rage, or hatred. Unlike most trapped spirits, onryō are motivated only by the desire to hurt others and can never be placated. While they are often powerful enough to kill outright, most prefer to antagonize their victims over time — they enjoy watching the living suffer.

An onryō’s appearance clearly betrays the cause of how they died. Roll `d66` or choose a column and roll `1d6`.
