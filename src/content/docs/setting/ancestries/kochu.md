Kōchū are wingless, bipedal, beetle-like humanoids who are native to the deep forests of Tsurukoku. They are renowned for their mastery of ikebana, the bamboo flute, and mushroom farming.

Kōchū resemble human-sized beetles, complete with antennae, mandibles, and compound eyes. They stand a foot or two taller than humans and weigh nearly twice as much. Unlike their small insect cousins, kōchū only possess four limbs: two segmented legs and two segmented arms ending in three-fingered hands.

Kōchū possess an exoskeleton made up of numerous plates separated by thin sutures. This provides maximum protection while maintaining flexibility. Their exoskeleton is typically jet black, though kōchū delight in painting themselves bright colors.

Like humans, kōchū exhibit sexual dimorphism — males tend to be a bit taller and a bit heavier than females.

Kōchū are herbivorous and fungivorous. They organize themselves into clans in the forests of central Tsurukoku and raise mushrooms, flowers, and trees.

Kōchū possess a rich and deep appreciation for the natural world. They are creative and nurturing, deliberate in movement, and peaceful in countenance. They tend to be slow to anger, quick to make friends, and eager to forgive slights.

One might assume that other races have a hard time relating to the kōchū due to their insect-like appearance, but the opposite tends to hold true. Because of their calm and easygoing nature, kōchū tend to get along well with everyone.

While kōchū are highly social creatures, they are also relentlessly artistic and creative. Many young kōchū set out from home looking to see the natural world and its wonders so that they can bring new knowledge back to their clans.
