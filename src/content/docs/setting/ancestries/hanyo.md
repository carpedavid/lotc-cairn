title: Hanyō
---

Hanyō are the children of mortals (typically humans) and yōkai. Most yōkai are feared by mortals, as they have a reputation for disguising themselves as alluring humans, and using their charm to seduce and consume their victims.

However, legends are filled with stories of yōkai falling in love with an intended victim, marrying, and then bearing children. Often, these marriages end unhappily when the yōkai’s true nature is discovered, with the yōkai leaving the family and returning to the spirit world. Every rule has exceptions, though; sometimes, the yōkai will raise the child, and, more rarely, the parents will remain together.

Regardless of a hanyō’s upbringing, their dual nature often drives conflict within themselves, their families, and communities.

Hanyō closely resemble humans, though their features tend to be fantastic and exaggerated, and they often have inhuman hair, skin, or eye colors. Depending on their ancestry, some hanyō sport horns or fangs, and they may stand up to a foot taller than their human counterparts and weigh up to fifty pounds more.

Hanyō mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer — typically up to 120 years.

Hanyō possess the same types of personality traits that normal humans do, but they tend toward extreme versions of them. The conflicting nature of their heritage often drives them toward chaotic behavior.

The chaotic personality of hanyō is often accompanied by an intense wanderlust. Some adventure to satisfy this drive, some adventure because they feel unwelcome in the society of their birth and some adventure to find their parents (often to take revenge).

Hanyō are looked upon with suspicion and fear by others. They must overcome initial hostile attitudes wherever they travel, though kitsune are normally the most accommodating towards them. They are typically shunned by the barbaric urokobito.

## Jorōgumo

Children of spider yōkai are the rarest sub-race of hanyō, in no small part because their yōkai parents are some of the most voracious. They tend to be taller and thinner than other types of hanyō, and possess a noticeable set of fangs. Their eyes and skin are typically of human coloration, but their hair may be dark blue, bright yellow, or bright red. Jorōgumo hanyō posses a supernatural vitality such that all colors the colors of their body and possessions appear to super-saturated and vibrant.

## Oni

Children of oni have horns of varying shapes and sizes. In addition to the human spectrum of skin, eye, and hair color, these hanyō may also have blue, red, or pure white coloration. Their most notable characteristic is a high body temperature which results in steam rolling from their mouths whenever they talk.

## Ryū

Children of dragons inherit a lithe, powerful build. They have antlers like their dragon parents, and males often have long, flowing facial hair. They typically have human skin tones, but yellow or green eyes. In addition to the normal human spectrum of hair color, these hanyō may have green, blue, yellow, or bright red hair. The hair and robes of ryū hanyō always appear to be blown about by a gentle breeze.

## Yukibito

Travelers fear the spirits which haunt the frozen mountains during Tsurukokan winters. Lost in a blizzard, a traveler will encounter a stunningly beautiful man or woman dressed in a thin kimono, who seems unaffected by the storm. These are the yukibito, whose very touch can turn an adventurer’s blood to ice. Children of yukibito inherit stunning violet eyes, jet-black hair, and snow-white skin. They radiate a chilling aura — the air is always a few degrees colder within a few feet of them.
