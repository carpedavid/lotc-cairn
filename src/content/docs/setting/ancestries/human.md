Humans are the most populous and adaptable of the civilized races. They not only exist, but thrive in every environment and fill every role available in Tsurukoku.

Humans stand, on average, about five to six and a half feet tall and weigh 120 to 200 lbs. Females tend to be shorter and lighter than males and typically have less muscle mass. Human skin color in Tsurukoku varies from dark brown to very light, though hair is universally black. Humans live, on average, about 70 years, and their short life spans cause them to move and adapt quickly.

Humans run the gamut of personality types: kind, mean, chivalrous, vindictive, predictable, disorganized and everything in between. Some are easily excitable and quick to take up arms, while others are calm and prefer to avoid conflict. Their only common characteristic is that they adapt easily to new circumstances, often adopting and assimilating characteristics from every culture that they encounter.

Humans become adventurers for almost as many reasons as there are adventurers: fame, fortune, faith, power, love, hate and happenstance are just a few of the motivating factors in a human’s choice to live an adventurer’s life.

As befits their extreme adaptability, humans get along well with all other races. They often adjust their own personalities and habits to accommodate companions of other races, and other races seem very comfortable having human companions.
