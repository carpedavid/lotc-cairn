Kitsune are a species of mischievous, humanoid foxes. They are the second most populous humanoid species in Tsurukoku, and live alongside humans in both rural and urban areas.

Kitsune resemble a human/fox hybrid, with vulpine facial features, including a pointed, slightly upturned muzzle, and erect ears. Depending on their ethnicity, their fur ranges from reddish-brown to a dull tan, to white, silver, black, or dark grey. Their eyes are a deep amber color and have vertically slit pupils, like a cat.

Kitsune are, on average, about as tall as humans, but are more slightly built. Like humans, males usually have greater muscle mass and stand a few inches taller than females.

Kitsune have an extremely long lifespan, upwards of nine hundred years. Every century, a kitsune will grow another tail, and the most venerable members of the species can end up with nine.

Kitsune are capricious and curious creatures. While they are not generally malicious, they do enjoy playing pranks and derive a deep sense of satisfaction from watching others get their just desserts. Kitsune almost always have some scheme in motion and treat others as though they do, as well.

As ascended canids, kitsune exhibit certain canine behaviors that other ascended species sometimes find unusual.

Within the kitsune community, there is significant debate on grooming. Kitsune from Tsurukoku have largely adopted the human practice of washing their coat with soap and water. Kitsune from the Hordelands, on the other hand, still exclusively practice oral grooming habits.

Even kitsune that have adopted a human style of grooming, though, will engage in mutual oral grooming with family and close friends. Parent kitsune commonly groom their young children this way, even when they, themselves, do not.

Unlike other humanoid canids, kitsune are not pack-oriented. Foxes are primarily solitary hunters who rely on stealth, and kitsune share this trait. While they can be perfectly social, their need for frequent isolation can sometimes be interpreted as arrogance or aloofness.

Kitsune have an insatiable appetite for new information and experiences, so much so that they will often work to generate new experiences when life does not provide them. Therefore, many kitsune take up the mantle of the adventurer in order to satiate this appetite, while others are forced into the life of adventure when they make things a little too interesting at home.
