## Ancestry and Background

First, roll on the Ancestry and Backgrounds tables below. Note the roll results, as you will need to refer to them for the next few steps.

Choose a Name from the available list, then roll on each of the included tables in your Ancestry and Background. Record your character’s items, skills, or abilities from each result.

Unless otherwise noted, every character starts with a Torch (3 uses), Rations (3 uses), and 3d6 Cranes (cr), the paper currency used in Tsurukoku.
